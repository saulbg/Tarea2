/* Extra Credit
Assign the characters into numbers and then use printf to print them a character at a time.
What kind of compiler warnings did you get?

Do the inverse for name , trying to treat it like an array of int and print it out one int at a time.
What does Valgrind think of that?

How many other ways can you print this out?

If an array of characters is 4 bytes long, and an integer is 4 bytes long, then can you treat the whole name
array like it's just an integer? How might you accomplish this crazy hack?

Take out a piece of paper and draw out each of these arrays as a row of boxes.
Then do the operations you just did on paper to see if you get them right.

Convert name to be in the style of another and see if the code keeps working.
